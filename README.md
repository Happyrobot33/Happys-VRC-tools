# Welcome to my VRC Tools repository!
This repo is to store a bunch of different tools ive written to do different things. Here is the VCC listing for the repo [Happys VRC Tools](https://www.matthewherber.com/Happys-VRC-tools/)

## Package Information
<details>
<summary>Package Window Consolidator</summary>

This package adds a tab along the top of the Unity editor that allows you to consolidate any other packages you have in that project into a single organized dropdown
an example dropdown would end up looking like this (Some public packages shown here)
- VRC Packages
    - Consolidate Packages
    - [OpenFlight](https://github.com/Mattshark89/OpenFlight-VRC)
        - Prefabs
            - ...
    - [Easy Quest Switch](https://github.com/JordoVR/EasyQuestSwitch)
    - [VRWorld Toolkit](https://github.com/oneVR/VRWorldToolkit)
        - Post Processing
            - ...
        - Custom Editors
            - ...
        - ...

Clicking on Consolidate Packages will attempt to pull everything into this structure that either isnt there or isnt the vrchat sdk
**Any packages that receive a update will require a re-run of the Consolidate Packages button. If a package breaks while using this function, all you need to do is remove the package that broke from the project and add it back in through the VCC. If you encounter a package that doesnt work/breaks this, let me know so I can fix it right away**
